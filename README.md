Changes the text to something else cursed. As of **v7 Pre-release 10**, I made my own changes. Stay tuned for more updates!

You can contribute by making your own changes in the bundle.properties file to help with the updating, but keep in mind:

- No NSFW text
- Thats it.

*If any of these rules are broken, your Pull Request will be closed following a message mentioning the rule broken also including a label saying "rule broken".*
